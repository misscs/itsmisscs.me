    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t remember how I learned about <a href="http://dashes.com">Anil Dash</a>, but I did and I was struck with the anecdote about why and how he started writing which apparently came out of a period of uncertainty. Uncertainty of what to do next, where to go. More on the relevance of that later. Since then I&#8217;ve wanted to back read his blog, but how does one go about getting all that content? I didn&#8217;t want to be restricted to reading it on iPadita&#8217;s data connection and Anil isn&#8217;t/wasn&#8217;t using a static site generator so downloading the repo was out of question.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.httrack.com/">HTTrack</a>, a free, relatively easy to use utility for scraping the web. &#8221;<em>It allows you to download a World Wide Web site from the Internet to a local directory, building recursively all directories, getting HTML, images, and other files from the server to your computer. HTTrack arranges the original site&#8217;s relative link-structure</em>&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.httrack.com/page/2/en/index.html">Download</a> your flavor for you OS. If you&#8217;re on a mac run <code>httrack -W</code> for simple prompt helper. Don&#8217;t let the verbose documentation or retro site scare you away. If you aren&#8217;t cataloging the whole internet, you&#8217;ll get exactly what you want with <code>httrack -W</code>.</p>

<p>For more details on the options you can pass, <a href="http://www.httrack.com/html/fcguide.html">start here</a>, <code>cmd + f</code> for <em>A Thorough Going Over</em>, and begin reading from there.</p>

<p>Happy Reading!</p>

<p>NB: This blog(http://www.labnol.org/internet/save-webpages-for-offline-reading/) lead me to HTTrack from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=httrack&amp;oq=httrack&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.1307j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=scrap%20blog%20site%20content%20to%20read%20later">this query</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Vagrantbox.es is a great resource for finding a base Vagrant box but many are out of date&#8230;mainly because the repo is 21 pull requests behind. So you can likely find more up to date box in the pull requests.</p>

<p>Not to defy convention, but since those pull requests are being ignored, here&#8217;s a link to a updated minimal CentOS 6.3 x86_64 box. It does not have any VirtualBox Guest Additions installed. I recommend using https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest it will save you a lot of headache and guess work. It doesn&#8217;t have Chef or Puppet. It does include the necessary packages to fasciliate installing Postgres on CentOS box</p>

<pre><code>yum install postgresql-devel
</code></pre>
